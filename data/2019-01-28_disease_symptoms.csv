In Europe especially (Green et al., 2013), and apparently in Taiwan (Webber et al., 2012), but only rarely in the USA (Trione and Roth, 1957; Trione, 1959), foliage is infected by wind-blown sporangia or zoospores. Initial infection arises via splash dispersal of propagules from soil to low-lying branches. Subsequent aerial spread is from sporangia and zoospores which have formed on the foliage (Trione, 1974) in cool wet conditions. New infections can spread into branches and the main stem, killing trees from the top down.",,,
